`datasaurus_dozen` is a dataset demonstrating the utility of visualization. 
These 12 datasets are equal in standard measures: mean, standard deviation, 
and Pearson's correlation. But they look very different
Run the chunk below to get more info about this dataset:

```{r}
?datasaurus_dozen
```

See what datasets are in the datasaurus_dozen:

```{r}
datasaurus_dozen %>% 
  distinct(dataset)
```

## Exercise 1
Pick 2 datasets and plot them next to one another
(I'd recommend scatterplot, use facets if you like)

## Exercise 2
For these same two datasets, find the mean and standard deviation
for the x and y variable in each. What did you find?
