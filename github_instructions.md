# Github Instructions

## At the beginning of the lab

To get the latest workshop materials onto your computer.

1. Open GitHub Desktop and double check that the "Current Repository" (in the top left) is **data-science-for-health-bms-24-25**. If it is not, select it from the drop down list.

> NOTE:
-  If you can't see **data-science-for-health-bms-24-25** visit the repo on Github [here](https://github.com/DDI-Students/data-science-for-health-bms-24-25)
-  Select "Code" (green button) -> Open with Github Desktop
-  In the local path select the folder you created for this course (probably `data_science`). This will make a copy of the folder from Github onto your computer.

2. Click `Pull origin` in the top right to get the latest material from the Github repository. If it says `Fetch origin`, click it just to make sure it's up to date.

## Before you start pair programming

1. Decide whose computer you will be using.
2. Create a directory for today in the format `week_xx_xx`. For example, `week_2_thurs`
3. Open **Windows Explorer** (or **Finder** on Mac) and copy the materials from **data-science-for-health-bms-24-25** from the week_x folder - you are going to work on it in your `week_xx_xx` folder. 
4. Open the first file to be worked on in RStudio. 
5. Continue on with the lab. 


## After you've finished

After a pair programming session, you will want to save your work to Github. Here's a recommended process to follow.
